This wasn’t created behind closed doors—it was the result of:\n\nThe Cardano Constitutional Conventions in Argentina & Kenya.\n63+ global workshops where people could provide input with discussions and revisions.\n\nMeaningful Improvements Over the Interim Constitution\nSeveral key enhancements make this Constitution a significant upgrade:\n\nClear guiding principles to align future governance actions.\nBetter treasury oversight to reduce single points of failure.\nA governance process that prioritizes participation and transparency.\n\nThis Constitution is a major improvement over the Interim version, and it sets the stage for further governance evolution. Voting Yes was the responsible choice to ensure progress continues."
