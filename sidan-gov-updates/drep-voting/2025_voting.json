It simply creates a ceiling that encourages discipline and focus.\n- Governance is still stabilizing. At this stage, we believe it's better to proceed cautiously and prove the treasury model works with smaller, more transparent allocations.\n- Without a cap, or with a higher cap, the treasury could be used inefficiently. A 200M limit forces the community to ask: What is essential? What delivers real value?\n- If more funding is genuinely needed later, the NCL can be adjusted through a future governance action. We see this as a checkpoint, not a final lock.\nWe understand this limit may not satisfy all funding ambitions for 2025. However, we believe it will strengthen confidence in the governance process, reduce potential ADA market impact, and provide a more structured budgeting environment for proposals moving forward.\nSIDAN Lab supports strategic investment in Cardano’s growth — but only when paired with clear, predictable, and measured spending limits. For that reason, we vote YES on this NCL proposal."

A delayed NCL or failed vote could cause a 60-day funding freeze, stalling community innovation and disproportionately benefiting large entities with early proposal traction.\nAt the same time, we share several concerns raised by those who voted NO:\n- We believe more governance infrastructure is needed—including clearer treasury oversight, tracking, and community visibility—before approving higher NCLs.\nA Yes vote could be seen as endorsing the current treasury governance structure without addressing its known shortcomings.\nA No vote could unintentionally delay needed funding, harming the same community builders we aim to support.\nGiven the above, SIDAN Lab is abstaining as a signal that:\n- We value progress and funding continuity, but also expect clearer NCL modeling and stronger oversight mechanisms in future treasury actions.\n- We will continue participating actively in treasury governance discussions, and support community-led initiatives to improve transparency, accountability, and access to funding."
